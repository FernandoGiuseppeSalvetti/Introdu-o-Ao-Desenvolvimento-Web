            <p>Francesco and Jane Bienni, founders and owners of San Francisco's world-class restaurant, have many
                reasons to celebrate. Cafe Townsend has been a San Francisco favorite for more than 19 years, and their
                latest restaurant venture, Cafe Isabella, will soon expand to more locations. Their biggest celebration
                is for their son Steven's recent graduation from New York's highly acclaimed Culinary Institute of
                America. San Francisco diners should join the Bienni's in their celebration because this graduation
                means an even better menu selection at Cafe Townsend, as Steven is lending his modern and innovative
                culinary talents to his father's traditional, Old World kitchen.</p>

                    What I am doing is using seasonal Italian ingredients and combining them to create dishes with a
                    modern flair that will invigorate our customers' palates, Steven says.

            <p>Those who have enjoyed Cafe Townsend and its world-class cuisine shouldn't worry - the stellar tableside
                service, scrumptious regional specials and menu favorites remain. But Steven's latest menu additions are
                something you don't want to miss.</p>
            <p>&quot;The utilization of regional seafood with the accompaniment of our fresh-grown herbs is something
                I'm avid about.&quot;</p>
